## Introduction

This is the Repository for my [dev.kylerianhd.com](https://dev.kylerianhd.com) Subdomain. Here you can use various tools of mine. All the features and examples are listed below.

## Features

- Simulates a basic Unix-like terminal interface
- Supports common commands: `help`, `clear`, `echo`, `whoami`, `ls`, `cd`
- Implements a basic file system navigation (each directory is a separate tool)
- Provides command history navigation (up/down arrow keys)
- Includes tab completion for commands and file paths
- Custom (retro) cursor with blinking effect

## Usage

Here are some things you can do:

- Type commands and press Enter to execute them
- Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate through command history
- Press Tab to autocomplete commands or file/directory names
- Try the following commands:
  - `help`: List available commands
  - `clear`: Clear the terminal screen
  - `echo [message]`: Display a message
  - `whoami`: Display current user
  - `ls`: List contents of the current directory
  - `cd [directory]`: Change the current directory

## Future Goals

- [X] Basic configuration and design.
